# fastmat

Important to note that this is a MATLAB code

To run the hurricane intensity simulator, it is important to have all these files in the same directory and run the "fast_model.m" code.

Datasets that are needed to succesfully run this code are all on the dropbox folder Sai and I have (this includes the Sea Surface Temperature Reanalysis data, the Relative Humididty and Surface Saturation Specific Humidity)


The Environmental Shear data has to be retrieved and downloaded into cygwin though ERA5 using the code that has already been developed by Sai and I.

The environmental shear mat file is too big for GitHub so that can also be found in the dropbox file it is named "shear0904". This contains information for all environmental wind shear for the month of september, 2004. If you need for another month, you will need to download data from ERA5.

The code named "envshear.py" is a python code and that is the code that is to be run on cygwin in order to download and retrieve the files though ERA5. This is just a template: if you want to recieve information from different times other than September 2004 simply edit this code.




please email at sdavila@mit.edu or sara.davila01@utrgv.edu if you have any further questions regarding this code and I will try my best to assist you.
